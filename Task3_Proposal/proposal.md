## Proposal: Migrating Open-Source AI CLI Tool to Scalable Cloud Infrastructure

### Objective
Deploy a CLI-based AI Assistant to a scalable and reliable cloud environment.

### Recommended Stack
- **Cloud:** AWS
- **Compute:** AWS ECS Fargate
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 for model artifacts
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + AWS CodePipeline + CodeDeploy
- **IaC:** Terraform
- **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch
- **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager

### Deployment Flow
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. GitHub Actions triggers CI steps (lint, test, Docker build).
3. Image is pushed to Amazon ECR.
4. CodePipeline deploys container to ECS Fargate.
5. App fetches model files from S3.

### Benefits
- Serverless compute (Fargate) reduces overhead.
- S3 is scalable and reliable for storing models.
- Terraform enables infrastructure automation.
